    <p>Play Pig Dice!</p>
    <p>Risk it all or play it safe with this exciting dice game.</p>
    <p>Every time a player rolls, he or she has to make a decision about their next move that could cost them the win. If the player has rolled any number from a 2 to a 6, they are free to collect points that are equal to the face value of their roll and they can roll again. OR they can decide to take the points and hold, handing the die over to the next player. If the player makes the call to decide to roll again and a 1 comes up, the points that they had from their initial roll are taken away, their turn is over, and their score for that round is a zero. For as long as they donâ€™t roll a 1 though, the player can continue to throw the dice and to accumulate points. The players take turns this way until one of them reaches 100 points and becomes the winner.</p>
